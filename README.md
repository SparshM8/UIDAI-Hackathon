# Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

## UIDAI Hackathon Submission

This repository contains our submission for the Online Hackathon on data-driven innovation for Aadhaar, organized by UIDAI in association with NIC and MeitY.

## Problem Statement
Identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators in Aadhaar enrolment and update data to support informed decision-making and system improvements.

## Our Solution
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of anonymized Aadhaar enrolment data to uncover societal trends and provide actionable insights for UIDAI.

## Key Findings
- **Total Enrolments**: 5,435,702 across 1,006,029 records
- **Demographic Focus**: 65.3% of enrolments are children aged 0-5
- **Geographic Leader**: Uttar Pradesh with 1,018,629 enrolments (18.7%)
- **Peak Activity**: July 1, 2025 recorded 616,868 enrolments
- **Correlations**: Strong positive correlations between age groups (0.85-0.95)

## Files Included
